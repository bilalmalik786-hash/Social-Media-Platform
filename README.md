# Social-Media-Platform
The functioning program will be judged on the basis of achievement and ambition. It is not enough to opt for an overly conservative set of objectives within the project and then expect to achieve a high mark with an argument that you met your specification. You are also counselled about the danger of being too ambitious – there is a limited amount of time available. Quality of code (quality, structure and documentation) will be considered and single file solutions are simply not acceptable. Appropriate multiple header and code files will be required. A submission based around code that is not organised as multiple .h, .cpp files nor adopts significant class based (OOP) design will result in a fail grade regardless. In the demonstration, each member of the project team must actively participate and describe the function of different aspects of the code. Answering questions and showing the operation of the entire project is a critical part of the assessment process. The quality of your answers will inform the marks given in the project and be used to inform any assessment of individual contribution. It is therefore extremely important that ALL team members fully understand the program, including any modules that were designed and written by their colleague, and contribute to the project. A student’s final mark will take into account of individual contributions to the project; based upon performance in demonstration, documentation in reports and logbook, attendance at lab sessions. One cannot simply rely on or leave it up to your project partner to complete the project and extract credit for this. The demonstration is a mini-viva for the project. The following are among the advanced features for which credit will be given for successful and appropriate use: (not exhaustive.) 
• class inheritance
 • separation of interfaces from implementation
 • operator overloading 
• pointers to build associations 
• references 
• containers (vector, lists or both)


The aim of this project is to design and implement a basic social media platform that allows users to create profiles, connect with other users, and share content such as text and images. The platform will be designed to be user-friendly and accessible to users of all ages and technical skill levels. The social media platform includes a variety of features that make it easy for users to connect with friends and family, as well as discover and follow new people and interests. This includes a news feed that displays content from other users and pages that the user has chosen to follow, as well as a search function that allows users to find and connect with other users based on interests, location, or other criteria. The platform also includes a messaging system that allows users to send direct messages to each other, as well as group messaging for multiple users. Users can also post updates to their own profiles, which are visible to their friends and followers. The platform is designed to be scalable, allowing it to handle a large number of users and activity. It also includes security features such as user authentication, password protection, and privacy settings to protect users’ personal information. Overall, the basic social media platform is a valuable tool for connecting with others and sharing content. With its user-friendly design, messaging system, and customizable features, the platform is a powerful way for users to stay connected and engaged with their social network
